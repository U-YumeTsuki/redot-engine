## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Redot Engine LTS](https://redotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of common tools, so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and consoles.

## Free, open source and community-driven

Redot is a completely free and open source fork of Godot under the very permissive MIT license.
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Redot's development is fully independent and truly
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining Godot)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.

Redot was forked from Godot in [September 2024](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/commit/a12e9de5dd831e1ce0c839f0420b278ef0a6aa5b),
intending to improve upon Godot in order to fulfill its potential and contribute to the shared
codebase of both through a more genuinely community-driven model than Godot.

## Getting the engine

### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Redot editor and the export templates will be found
[on the Redot website](https://redotengine.org/download) once it's set up and on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine) until then.

### Compiling from source

[See the official docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/engine_details/development/compiling)
for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

#### Using Nix (recommended)

If you have the Nix package manager installed, you can build and run the editor in one command:

```bash
nix run .
```

This will automatically install all build dependencies and compile Redot if the binary doesn't exist.

For manual control over the build process:

```bash
# Enter the Nix development environment
nix develop

# Build Redot (use 'macos' on macOS, 'linuxbsd' on Linux)
scons platform=linuxbsd  # or: scons platform=macos

# Run the editor - binary name reflects your platform and architecture
# Examples: redot.linuxbsd.editor.x86_64, redot.macos.editor.arm64
./bin/redot.<platform>.editor.<arch>
```

Nix works on Linux and macOS, and is available at [nixos.org/download.html](https://nixos.org/download.html). The `nix run .` command automatically detects your platform and architecture.


## AI Integration (Model Context Protocol)

Redot includes a native **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server, allowing AI coding assistants (like OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Zed) to interact directly with your game project.

### Tools Overview
The MCP server provides 5 master controllers:

*   **`redot_scene_action`**: Manage `.tscn` files (add nodes, set properties, instance scenes, and wire signals with automatic callback generation).
*   **`redot_resource_action`**: Manage `.tres` files and assets (create/modify materials, themes, inspect `.import` metadata).
*   **`redot_code_intel`**: Deep script analysis (GDScript syntax validation, symbol extraction, and engine documentation lookup).
*   **`redot_project_config`**: Project-level control (configure Input Map, Autoloads, run/stop the game, read logs, and res:// I/O).
*   **`redot_game_control`**: Vision & Interaction (capture screenshots, click UI elements with high-precision, and inspect the live scene tree recursively).

### Running the MCP Server

#### 1. Using the compiled binary (Standard)
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "redot": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "/path/to/redot.editor.binary",
        "--headless",
        "--mcp-server",
        "--path",
        "/path/to/your/project"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Running Unit Tests
You can execute automated tests headlessly using the `--run-tests` flag:
```bash
./bin/redot.<platform> --headless --run-tests=res://tests/my_test.gd
```
*Note: Your test script should have a `func run():` method.*


#### 3. Using Nix (For Development)
If you are developing inside a Nix environment, use the provided wrapper to ensure all libraries are correctly linked:

1. Locate the `redot-mcp.sh` script in the engine root.
2. In your `opencode.json` or MCP client config, use:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "redot": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["/path/to/redot-engine/redot-mcp.sh", "/path/to/your/project"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### AI Agent Best Practices
To get the most out of Redot's MCP server, agents should follow these guidelines:

1.  **Scene Editing**: Use `redot_scene_action` for all `.tscn` modifications. Avoid editing TSCN files as raw text to prevent breaking node UIDs and internal references.
2.  **Scripting**: For existing `.gd` files, use **native text editing tools** (like `edit`) for precise logic changes. Use `redot_project_config(action="create_file_res")` only when creating new scripts from scratch.
3.  **Live Interaction**: Always `wait` 3-5 seconds after `run` before attempting vision or input actions to allow the bridge to initialize.
4.  **Spatial Awareness**: Use `redot_game_control(action="inspect_live", recursive=true)` to discover UI paths and their pre-calculated screen coordinates for 100% accurate clicking.
5.  **Debugging**: Use `redot_project_config(action="output")` to read real-time logs and `redot_code_intel(action="validate")` to syntax-check fixes before running the game.
6.  **Script Editing Policy**: The MCP tool `create_file_res` is restricted to creating **new** files. To edit existing `.gd` scripts, agents **must** use native text editing tools (like `edit`). This ensures precision and prevents accidental overwrites of complex logic.

## ReX Engine

Looking to try out new features that aren't backwards compatible with Godot, or would you like to create new features for Redot Engine that can't be added here due to compatibility issues?

Meet us over at the [ReX Engine Repo](https://github.com/redot-rex/rex-engine) Where we aim to create a modern engine using Redot Engine as a starting point, free from godots choices and shortcomings, and innovate in ways not currently possible here within Redot Engine.
