/**
 * @file mode7_scanline_override.h
 *
 * This class is a companion to mode7_sprite_2d.h
 * One or more instances are intended to be used in an array in the Inspector.
 * As the Super Nintendo was able to have a different transformation each scanline,
 * it essentially manipulated each one when doing effects such as projections.
 *
 * The intent of this is to bring a more modern/intuitive tool to produce that effect.
 * Using 2 Mode7ScanlineOverride objects in the array on the Mode7Sprite2D, interpolation
 * can be set to Lerp or Projection.  Projection is designed around 2.
 * Lerp will interpolate all of the values in between however many of these objects are
 * added to the array.
 *
 * The Mode7Sprite2D will always start with just one Mode7ScanlineOverride,
 * which can be used for a straight-up affine transformation.
